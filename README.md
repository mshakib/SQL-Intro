# CS-1222 Introduction to Database

Welcome to the introduction to database course!

We will be learning some basic terms and concepts of relational database and the
non-relational database like NoSQL databases.

You will be learning syntax of SQL and being able to design tables yourself and
transition this knowledge to NoSQL databases.

After taking this course, you will be able to read/write SQL code to
read/store/manipulate data into database.

## Prerequisites

As this course is 100 level courses, I do not expect any of you to have any
programming background. Thus, the course will assume you know nothing and teach
everything from ground up.

Although it is not required but please be familiar with terminal(Command line
interface on windows). Most of the examples within lectures will be in terminal.

> While some may be in the MySQL workbench, I'd prefer to do everything in terminal

I do recommend you to have a programming text-editor ready like
[Sublime Text][2] or [Atom][3] installed on your computer so you can code.
